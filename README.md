##File Search

File Search is an IntelliJ IDEA plugin that lets you search your computer for files by name from within your IDE.

###System Requirements

File Search works with all recent versions of each of the IDEs Jetbrains makes
that are based on IntelliJ IDEA with one major requirement:

**File Search requires that IntelliJ IDEA runs on JRE8**

Most Mac users are probably do not meet this requirement unless they installed IntelliJ IDEA with the version
that bundles it's own JRE.

You can [download a bundled version of IntelliJ IDEA here](https://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/IntelliJIDEA/Previous+IntelliJ+IDEA+Releases).

###Installation

Simply open your Plugin Browser via Settings and search for "File Search". You can also 
[download File Search from jetbrains.com](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7867?pr=) or build it via the source
code available here.

###Usage

Go to Tools -> Find Files by Name or Cmd/Alt+Shift+A and type "Find Files by Name"

You should see a dialog appear:
